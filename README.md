canvas-fingerprinting
=====================

Motivated by the paper "Pixel Perfect: Fingerprinting Canvas in HTML5" by Mowery and Shacham (published in 2012), I tried to implement a minimal example, which is similar to their results. Rendering a WebGL scene to a canvas element, create a difference map to compare the rendered image with a original image. The result depends on the graphics driver and GPU.
